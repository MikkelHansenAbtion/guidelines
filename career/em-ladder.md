# Engineering Management Career Ladder
This career ladder serves to give an overview of how you can progress your
career at Abtion and become an Engineering Manager.

As a prerequisite, we require people to have moved beyond level 2 on our [IC
career ladder](https://github.com/abtion/guidelines/blob/main/career/ladder.md)

required as we believe it is important that you have grown your technical
skills to a certain level before you start leading highly technical individuals.
