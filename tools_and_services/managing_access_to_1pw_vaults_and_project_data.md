# How do we guard our logins and manage access to project data and 1pw?

#### The basic rules and culture:
1. we educate ourselves to be our own gate keeper
  - When asking permission to grand access to fx. Heroku or 1pw vaults, ALSO ask to be removed after a reasonable time finishing the task. 
  - Only have access to the data and Vaults that you are actively working on.
  - Ask to eliminate access when you can enter data/Vaults of projects you are not working on.
2. People granding access are Hari, Angelle and PM

#### 1pw structure:
1. Main rules:
  - Always generate codes via 1pw
  - Always save it in the right Vault
  - Delete unused login's to services and update vault members
2. Each project has their own Vault
  - Only active teammembers have access to the Vault. 
  - When a teammember is switching to an other projects, he/she ask's to decline access.
  - The project's main developers, (people with most knowledge), will remain access to the Vault.
