# How to purchase licenses or memberships and how to document this?

1) Ask for approval when needed. (Angelle, your PM or manager)
Look at this from a reflective angle, to make sure we buy the right license and to keep the commmunication and purchasing transperant. This makes it is easier to refer to the person responsible in case questions pop up. In general we approave all purchases.

2) Create a user that can be accessed by an admin: (This for a smooth on- and offboarding process)
   - admin@abtion.com + generate a code in 1pw + save it in the right vault. 
     - The right vault could be a 'team' or 'licences' when it is a common license.  
   - personal abtion email + generate a code in 1pw + save it in the right vault.
   - when several licenses are bought for the same account, a manager license might be needed to keep a better overview and reassign/cancel single licenses. Check this and reach out to Angelle when you have any questions. 
  
3) Create a billing email: (This to have one place to gather invoices/receipts)
   - admin+billing+<name_of_product>+<name_responsible>@abtion.com
   - when not able to create a billing email, use either admin@abtion.com as login, or redirect the incomming invoices to admin+billing@abtion.com

4) Update the license overview in Asana

5) Use the card credentials in 1pw under 'admin+billing@abiton.com'
   - For bigger purchases, pleo might ask for a verification via 2fa, reach out to Angelle for assistance in this case.
